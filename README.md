# password-strength-evaluation
Comprehensive analysis of password strength using online tools, with security best practices, attack types, and interview prep. Includes PDF report, screenshots, and README.
# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation 

## 📘 Overview
This project explores password strength by testing multiple samples using online tools like [PasswordMeter](https://www.passwordmeter.com). It also summarizes best practices and common attack types to strengthen cybersecurity awareness.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create passwords with varying complexity
- Evaluate strength using online tools
- Analyze feedback and identify best practices
- Research common password attacks
- Prepare for cybersecurity interviews

## ✅ Best Practices Learned
- Use 12+ characters
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid dictionary words and personal info
- Don’t reuse passwords across platforms
- Use passphrases and password managers

## 🔓 Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type          | Description                                                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Brute Force*        | Tries every possible combination; longer passwords resist better         |
| *Dictionary Attack*  | Uses known words and common passwords; weak passwords fall quickly       |
| *Credential Stuffing*| Uses leaked passwords from other sites; reused passwords are vulnerable  |
